Red, like he asked to Santas's elves (actually a second hand Cnoc 14 Islabike with barely a scratch we drove 3 hours to get). Unfortunately, his legs were a few centimetres too short. He kept asking if his legs were long enough every single week. In February, 1 month before his third birthday, we gave it another try and he could just about reach the ground with the tip of his toes... We walked to a park nearby, sat him on the saddle and gave him a good push... And as expected he fell down. But he was keen to try again and before an hour - and a few more falls - he understood the direction that the pedals are supposed to rotate. And off he went, with Dad running behind to stop him at every crossing.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00162.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00162-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"First 10 metres...\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00170.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00170-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00172.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00172-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"and cycling by himself\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>On day 2, we strapped his little bike on the back of his trailer and set off to the long cycle lane between Cambridge and St Yves. We stopped for a picnic break in the lovely village of Swavesey and started cycling back to Cambridge, but this time with an extra pair of wheels on the tarmac. Not only did he manage really well, but he did so for 6 km before being too tired to continue and dozing off for a nap in his trailer. When he woke up 1 hour later, we were back in Cambridge, and he immediately asked to get on his bike again. So we cycled back home with him for the last 4 km, first though a park, then on quiet roads. 10 km in total !!! </p>\n<div style=\"padding: 0 0 0 0; position: relative;\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/530505714?byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>\n<script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>\n</p>\n<p>Since then, he has been progressing very fast, 6 weeks later he is now able to start pedalling by himself, to brake and control his speed (most of the time, but Dad is never very far) and more recently he started standing up before bumps and potholes. He is definitely a fast learner, but he has been spending a lot of time on our bikes and in his trailer since he is 5 months old.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00254.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00254-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Spring ride in Wandlebury park</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00436.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00436-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Along the Cam at dusk</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00249.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00249-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Leading the way on a trail</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00409.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00409-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Another dusk ride in Coleridge common</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00316-2.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00316-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Riding on BRCA2 on the DNA cycle lane</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00417.JPG\" data-size=\"6000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/12/gallery/DSC00417-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>Reflecting on the meaning of life</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>",

This was Our Dream and we were so thrilled to imagine the Three of us together exploring such fantastic places and meeting extraordinary people. Unfortunately, like so many people, our plan <span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">has been crushed by the major health crisis. It was not an easy decision, it took some time to accept it but it was probably the best decision at that time. However, </span><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">we hope to be on the road for a long Journey in few years time with Oscar on his bike and not in the trailer. And maybe this one will be bigger and really 'around the world'?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">In the meantime, we will do our best to enjoy smaller trips. </span></p>\n<p>Cycling altogether really saved us during the different lockdowns. There has been a sense of freedom despite the restrictions. We are lucky to live in the UK where the distance for exercising outside with your household was not restricted. I must say that winter was not the funniest season with closed pubs and so nowhere to get warm during breaks. Nevertheless, we bought a snow suit and boots for Oscar to keep him warm in the trailer and we braved the cold!</p>\n<p>What is great when you cycle long distances during weekends and holidays (and why you should try ;) ):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You explore, I mean really explore, the paths / cities / towns / villages / nature .. you go through. </li>\n<li>It is environmentally friendly. </li>\n<li>You get to exercise while having fun and then can stop in nice pubs / cafés , and eat/ drink what you fancy without hesitation!</li>\n<li>You meet lovely and curious people that ask you where you go, where you come from, and sometimes truly beautiful people that offer you hot drinks and cakes while it is pouring with rain!</li>\n<li>You learn how to adapt yourself to unexpected situations (weather forecast, ...). </li>\n<li>It is cheaper (well when you are already equipped..!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am sure we could add more to the list above, and since we discovered this means of travelling, it is difficult to imagine ourselves on a different journey.</p>\n<p>We often combine our trips with trains and this is great, we love trains. You can relax, observe the landscape, meet people, and again it is environmentally friendly. The journey is really part of the adventure when we go somewhere. </p>\n<p>From the point of view of our little one, we think it is a great way to explore the world with Mummy and daddy. So far he has been in his trailer We have (<a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null\" title=\"https://tout-terrain.de/en/the-products/trailers/431/singletrailer?c=107\">Tout terrain single trailer</a>) during our long cycling days. Some people might think 'oh but isn't he bored? it is long for him without moving'. Actually we think that Oscar is living his best life in his trailer on the road with us. Well, we hope. When he is in his trailer, our very energetic little boy becomes so calm, soothed by the rhythm of pedalling. There are plenty of things to do in the trailer: observing, singing, speaking, reading, collecting flowers through mummy and daddy, playing with his baby doll, napping... We obviously try to choose appropriate and fun break locations so Oscar has got a nice playground or park to run and play. We just bought a <a href=\"#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/NaN\" title=\"https://www.followmetandem.co.uk/followme-tandems/folllowme_tandem.php\">follow me</a> since Oscar is very keen to ride his bike and I am sure that Oscar will enjoy this a lot.</p>\n<p>On top of cycling for fun and adventure, it is our main means of commuting and thus we are on our bike everyday for work, shopping, etc..</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

After 5 pm, we started an easy ride with fantastic landscapes particularly with the light at this time of the day. It reminded us some sceneries from Nepal. However, it was not very long until the path became more challenging.  We had to start hiking our bikes and Adrien even offered to carry my big bag which was life-saving. Dilemma when we saw 2 different paths , one going up, the other one down, it looked like it was going to the same point so we decided to take the easy way and to go down... Big mistake, the lake was so full of water that our path was at some point water-covered. The sun had already set and it was already dusk so we did not have lots of time and we had to turn back and try the other path. We turned on our lights and our amazing Oscar was a fantastic cheer leader and really kept us going. What a wonderful arrival at the bothy discovering it was open and we were on our own. The dinner was much appreciated after such an adventure and our little Oscar whispering 'I am happy to grow up' before drifting off said it all.</p>\n<h2>To Bonar Bridge</h2>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_103308.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_103308-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Early ride down</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_104355-Copie.jpg\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_104355-Copie-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_114226-01.jpeg\" data-size=\"2864x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_114226-01-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"754\"></a>\n<figcaption>The School of Life</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_114454.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_114454-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bothy School House</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_122129.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_122129-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_122149.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_122149-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_182652.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_182652-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Our 'pod' for the night</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_211927-Copie.jpg\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/IMG_20200917_211927-Copie-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Family time</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>After our amazing night, we jumped on our bikes for a challenging and fun ride down the valley.

The first day was easy as we had back wind, and so we decided to cycle a bit longer than planed and even ended up in a B&amp;B where we met a truly lovely Lady Mary (<a href=\"https://borve.scot/\">https://borve.scot/</a>). However, the second  day was clearly heavy ahead wind. It is definitely what I dislike the most, like the impression to fight against the invincible. Someone we met during this trip told us that as he got older he has managed to tame the wind and he is not fighting against any more but rather accepts it and it is helping. Well, I think I need to get older. The less than 40 km felt like 120 km. We were glad to reach our camping when we then realised that we chose one very exposed to the wind... The night was disturbed and Adrien made sure many times that the tent could not fly off. Despite all of this, Oscar did sleep really well, probably sooth by the noise of the wind.

Some are vast and stretch on for miles, like West Beach on Berneray and Tràigh Eais on Barra, and here you can take cover below high dunes and enjoy watching dramatic waves on stormy days. Others are more sheltered bays, like the Prince’s Strand on Eriskay and the east beach on Vatersay, where you can enjoy picnics or wild swimming in the clear, luminescent water.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">On North Uist the landscape of wild peat moors and cultivated crofts is a maze of innumerable trout-filled lochs and inlets – more than half the ‘land’ here is water. Further down the chain, South Uist is a rugged and mountainous island where long sea lochs indent the east coast. In the summer months there is an explosion of colourful wildflowers on the machair plains of these islands. Carpets of harebells, clovers and orchids bloom, and long coastal grasses grow despite often hostile weather conditions. If fauna rather than flora is what you seek, you will find an impressive variety of native and visiting birds both on- and offshore and at the RSPB Balranald nature reserve.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">A 40-minute ferry journey south from Eriskay (the real Whisky Galore island) brings you to beautiful Barra, a popular island with a strong Hebridean character, where more than half of the population still speak Gaelic. Joined to its southern end by a causeway is the peaceful and remote isle of Vatersay, which is so deeply indented by the sea on both sides that only a narrow strip of land prevents it separating into two. Both islands, like the Uists, offer plenty of opportunities for wild camping or longer breaks in charming, traditional self-catering cottages. The ‘long chain’ is also a popular route with cyclists, who can stop overnight at many of the great hostels and campsites along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">The best time to visit is in May or June; this is before the midges arrive, when the machair is in bloom and you’re most likely to have sunshine as you take in the glowing expanses of white sand and bright azure sea at some of the most wonderful beaches in Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"calibre_pb_2\" class=\"noindentp\"><strong class=\"calibre4\">A journey to the northernmost islands in the Outer Hebrides – Lewis and Harris and St Kilda – is a memorable experience at any time of year. These isolated, windswept and mostly treeless islands hold some of the most outstanding landscapes in the world.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">Begin your Hebridean adventure by sailing to the principle island, Lewis and Harris. Commonly taken for two islands, it is in fact just one, but of two distinct characters. The northern part, Lewis, is largely a low-lying land of pool-mottled peat bogs, although it also contains Stornoway, the most populous town in the Hebrides and the centre of Gaelic culture and speech. The island is home to a lively working population with strong traditional and religious values. Many of the islanders belong to one of the five Presbyterian churches and you’ll still find that almost all shops are closed on Sundays.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">As you travel south into Harris there’s a dramatic shift in the terrain. The landscapes suddenly become wild and rugged, the expanses of flat moorlands broken up by dark mountains and surrounded by spectacular beaches. A great place to experience all of these is at Losgaintir, where miles of pristine white sand and glassy azure-green water contrast with more distant views of the forbidding North Harris mountains.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">Both areas are full of ancient treasures: step inside the magically reconstructed Iron Age house at Bosta or spend the night in one of the traditional blackhouses at Gearrannan. You can swim here before watching the sun set over the bay where women and children would have waited anxiously for their men to return from sea on small fishing boats.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">If you visit between April and September and the weather is on your side, you might also make the long, rough boat journey to the islands on ‘the edge of the world’, the exceptionally isolated archipelago of St Kilda. These islands, lying over 100 miles west of the mainland, form one of a very few World Heritage Sites to hold status for both natural and cultural merits. They have a truly fascinating history and boast breathtakingly dramatic scenery, with a series of staggering, dark sea stacks scattered in the sea around towering cliffs. These host puffins, petrels and gannets, while rare-breed sheep descended from ancient flocks survive on the islands. You might have to make a few attempts to get there, but visiting these islands is a truly powerful experience and one you will never forget.</p>",

We had planned to take a third and last train to Stirling, the starting point of the adventure... But... all the trains were cancelled that day. Damned! Plan B, we managed to get on a train which dropped us in Dunferline 30 km from Stirling. We actually started to cycle a day earlier than expected and it turned out to be a nice warm-up on a quiet and easy off-road cycle path. We even managed to arrive before dusk and had a short stroll in the quaint Stirling town centre.

It started with a gentle but steady climb along the river Lochay which then suddenly became much harder as the small gravel road climbed steeply up to a pass via a series of hairpin turns. We had to push the bikes a few times when the slope was too steep to pedal but it was well worth the effort. Then after that riding on the rocky path along Loch Lyon was tough and very technical but definitely rewarding as well. The panorama on the loch and further down the glen was breathtaking.</p>\n<p>This was the first wild camping night was planned but the weather was threatening and very windy, which had the benefit of keeping the midges at bay. Luckily, we were able to shelter in a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/56°32'36.5\" n=\"\" 4=\"\" 35=\"\" 23=\"\" 1=\"\" w=\"\">disused sheep sheering hut </a>full of huge torn open wool bags where we pitched our tent and had a very good night.</p>\n<p>The following day we continued our way along the loch and had to cross quite a few fords, which Oscar enjoyed a lot. It took us a few hours to cycle back to civilisation at the Bridge of Orchy. Overall this route was absolutely stunning but certainly more suitable for MTBs (we saw a few) than gravel bikes. Still, we were very impressed by our Niner bikes, even if it was hard work. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_171547.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_171547-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Mel riding by the Loch Lyon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_163723.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200907_163723-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Loch Lyon dam</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01890.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01890-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>One of our finest night in a semi abandoned sheep shearing hut</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01905.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01905-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>One of the many ford crossing too deep to ride on the way down</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01903.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01903-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Throwing pebbles in the river.

We followed a small winding road along the River Orchy. I seemed pretty but to be honest we just kept pushing hard for a few hours, during which Oscar had a long nap nested in the warmth of his trailer. We allowed ourselves a small detour and a short pause to dry off and buy smoked salmon, hot drinks and cake at <a href=\"https://www.smokedsalmon.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inverawe smokehouses</a>. Finally, we stopped for the night in a rustic hut found on AirBnB a couple of days ago. Nonetheless, it was a very welcome stop which allowed us to dry our drenched gear around the wood burner and to rest our legs after this long rainy day. </p>\n<p>The following day was much drier and we only had a short distance to get to Oban. We followed the National cycle route 78 through the stunningly beautiful glen Lonan, where we ran away from a  mildly aggressive herd of Highland cows charging us out of their land. We arrived in Oban just before noon, but had to rush buying so extra wet weather cycling gear (in anticipation for the dire forecast). At the end of the day, we grab sandwiches and jumped into the ferry to the Hebrides without having time to sample Oban's renowned freshly caught shellfish on the seafood huts by the pier.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_133642.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_133642-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>Under the rain near loch Awe</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_161535.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_161535-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Quick stop to dry at Inverawe Smokehouses</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_172504.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_172504-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Taking a \"shortcut\" near Taynuilt</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_092940.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_092940-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Maid's hut in Taynuilt</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_184804.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200908_184804-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a>\n<figcaption>Mini-bath for Oscar</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_100057.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/IMG_20200909_100057-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Through the beautiful Glen Lonan</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01914.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01914-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Glen Lonan's killer highland cows</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01919.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/4/gallery/DSC01919-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Oban ferry terminal to the islands</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>",

It was a fantastic holiday, but we took it easy because Oscar was only 1 year old. I rode my old  Specialized mountain bike and Melanie had a lightweight CUBE hybrid bike (which was stolen since 😭 ). Good bikes, but definitely not suitable for long distance touring.</p>\n<p>This year we bought 2 brand new Niner RLT9 gravel bikes from Mike Allenby at <a href=\"https://www.stage1cycles.co.uk/\">Stage1Cycle</a> in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales.  We were supposed to get them in April/May 2020, but COVID-19 happened. Long story short, Mike managed to get the 2 Niner framesets during the lockdown and assembled the bikes with the components we wanted. As soon as the lockdown was lifted in June, we swiftly drove up to collect our bikes and explored the stunning Yorkshire Dales National park. Since then we rode pretty much every weekend progressively increasing the distance, technical difficulty and load.</p>\n<p>We also \"trained\" Oscar to get used to spend time in his tout-terrain trailer. And it payed off. He is now happy to stay entire days harnessed in the trailer, singing, asking hundreds of questions or just observing nature quietly. We just need to have a small break every 1 or 2 hours, so he can burn his energy by running around, screaming and chasing birds (or anything else that moves really).</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01686.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01686-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_112502-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_112502-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00786-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00786-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200620_143222-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200620_143222-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_111837-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200831_111837-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200822_170312-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x4000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/IMG_20200822_170312-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00676-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00676-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00771-2.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00771-2-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00801-3.JPG\" data-size=\"3672x4896\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC00801-3-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01688.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01688-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01607.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01607-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01580.JPG\" data-size=\"4896x3672\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/gallery/DSC01580-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Itinerary overview</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.visitouterhebrides.co.uk/see-and-do/activities/hebridean-way/hebridean-way-cycling-route\">Hebridean way</a> was on our list of mythical route to ride for quite some time. But, the north coast of Spain was also quite high on that list... Well, at least COVID19 helped us to decide where to go for our first big cycle touring adventure. Our planned itinerary starts from the city of Stirling, easily accessible by train and will get us through the magical lochs of the Trossachs before reaching Oban. From there we will board a ferry to the little island of Barra. For nearly a week, we will cycle North through Eriksay, South and North Uist, Benbecula, Grimsay, Berneray and finally Lewis and Harris. Then we will cross the sea back to the mainland in Ullapool and will slowly make our way to Inverness, where our tour will end. Well at least that's our plan...</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/Scotland_map-en2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-xs.png 300w ,https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-sm.png 480w ,https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-md.png 749w ,https://adrenalinemie.github.io/media/posts/9/responsive/Scotland_map-en2-xl.png 1200w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<h2>COVID-19 means planning everything </h2>\n<p>It's not our habit but because of COVID-19 we decided to plan most of the nights. It was particularly hard to find accommodations on the Hebrides where pretty much everything is still closed for business until 2021 or already fully booked months in advance. Overall, the Hebrides managed quite well to keep the virus out and people are still reluctant to reopen the islands to mainland tourists. At the end of the day we managed to book 9 out of 14 nights, leaving just a few nights for wild camping or last minute B&amp;B. We planned a couple of nights in a beautiful cottage on Lewis, roughly in the middle of the trip so we can rest a bit to recharge our batteries.</p>\n<p><strong>Scotland, here we come !</strong></p>",
