            "summary": "The southern half of the Outer Hebrides is made up of a long chain of diverse islands. The Uists, which seem more water than land, are joined by a causeway, as is little Eriskay. Lying not far south of them, Barra and the Barra Isles are reached by ferry. These&hellip;",
            "content_html": "<p id=\"calibre_pb_2\" class=\"noindentp\"><strong class=\"calibre4\">The southern half of the Outer Hebrides is made up of a long chain of diverse islands. The Uists, which seem more water than land, are joined by a causeway, as is little Eriskay. Lying not far south of them, Barra and the Barra Isles are reached by ferry.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">These beautiful remote isles are world famous for their spectacular beaches. Some are vast and stretch on for miles, like West Beach on Berneray and Tràigh Eais on Barra, and here you can take cover below high dunes and enjoy watching dramatic waves on stormy days. Others are more sheltered bays, like the Prince’s Strand on Eriskay and the east beach on Vatersay, where you can enjoy picnics or wild swimming in the clear, luminescent water.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">On North Uist the landscape of wild peat moors and cultivated crofts is a maze of innumerable trout-filled lochs and inlets – more than half the ‘land’ here is water. Further down the chain, South Uist is a rugged and mountainous island where long sea lochs indent the east coast. In the summer months there is an explosion of colourful wildflowers on the machair plains of these islands. Carpets of harebells, clovers and orchids bloom, and long coastal grasses grow despite often hostile weather conditions. If fauna rather than flora is what you seek, you will find an impressive variety of native and visiting birds both on- and offshore and at the RSPB Balranald nature reserve.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">A 40-minute ferry journey south from Eriskay (the real Whisky Galore island) brings you to beautiful Barra, a popular island with a strong Hebridean character, where more than half of the population still speak Gaelic. Joined to its southern end by a causeway is the peaceful and remote isle of Vatersay, which is so deeply indented by the sea on both sides that only a narrow strip of land prevents it separating into two. Both islands, like the Uists, offer plenty of opportunities for wild camping or longer breaks in charming, traditional self-catering cottages. The ‘long chain’ is also a popular route with cyclists, who can stop overnight at many of the great hostels and campsites along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">The best time to visit is in May or June; this is before the midges arrive, when the machair is in bloom and you’re most likely to have sunshine as you take in the glowing expanses of white sand and bright azure sea at some of the most wonderful beaches in Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"calibre_pb_2\" class=\"noindentp\"><strong class=\"calibre4\">A journey to the northernmost islands in the Outer Hebrides – Lewis and Harris and St Kilda – is a memorable experience at any time of year. These isolated, windswept and mostly treeless islands hold some of the most outstanding landscapes in the world.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">Begin your Hebridean adventure by sailing to the principle island, Lewis and Harris. Commonly taken for two islands, it is in fact just one, but of two distinct characters. The northern part, Lewis, is largely a low-lying land of pool-mottled peat bogs, although it also contains Stornoway, the most populous town in the Hebrides and the centre of Gaelic culture and speech. The island is home to a lively working population with strong traditional and religious values. Many of the islanders belong to one of the five Presbyterian churches and you’ll still find that almost all shops are closed on Sundays.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">As you travel south into Harris there’s a dramatic shift in the terrain. The landscapes suddenly become wild and rugged, the expanses of flat moorlands broken up by dark mountains and surrounded by spectacular beaches. A great place to experience all of these is at Losgaintir, where miles of pristine white sand and glassy azure-green water contrast with more distant views of the forbidding North Harris mountains.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">Both areas are full of ancient treasures: step inside the magically reconstructed Iron Age house at Bosta or spend the night in one of the traditional blackhouses at Gearrannan. You can swim here before watching the sun set over the bay where women and children would have waited anxiously for their men to return from sea on small fishing boats.</p>\n<p class=\"noindenta\">If you visit between April and September and the weather is on your side, you might also make the long, rough boat journey to the islands on ‘the edge of the world’, the exceptionally isolated archipelago of St Kilda. These islands, lying over 100 miles west of the mainland, form one of a very few World Heritage Sites to hold status for both natural and cultural merits. They have a truly fascinating history and boast breathtakingly dramatic scenery, with a series of staggering, dark sea stacks scattered in the sea around towering cliffs. These host puffins, petrels and gannets, while rare-breed sheep descended from ancient flocks survive on the islands. You might have to make a few attempts to get there, but visiting these islands is a truly powerful experience and one you will never forget.</p>",

Our planned itinerary starts from the city of Stirling, easily accessible by train and will get us through the magical lochs of the Trossachs before reaching Oban. From there we will board a ferry to little island of Barra. During nearly a week, we will cycle North through Eriksay, South and North Uist, Benbecula, Grimsay, Berneray and finally Lewis and Harris. Then we will cross the sea back to Ullapool on the mainland and will slowly join Inverness, where our tour will end.
