We met in secondary school at the bottom of a climbing wall and quickly became very good friends. Then, each of us went a different way in University and we lost contact for a while until we met again 5 years later, and stuck together for good that time. By that time she travelled to 3 different continents and had a passport full of fancy stamps, while I barely left France. Mel is way more compassionate and empathetic than I will probably ever be and she deeply cares about social injustice, in particular in developing countries. During Medical School, she was involved in setting up <a href="https://www.instagram.com/songtaaba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Song Tabaa</a> a charity to help developing h<span class="text">ealthcare prevention and infrastructure</span> in Burkina Faso rural communities. After she graduated as a psychiatrist we traveled around Asia for 6 months and she pushed for us to spend 2 months volunteering in a Nepali school, which turned out to be the highlight of the trip. Moving to England, was a much harder task for her than it was for me. Doctors in France don't get to learn a lot of English. Psychiatry in particular can be pretty tough when it is not your native language. But she bravely took on the challenge, and before we knew she was a consultant at the NHS, which at 30 is actually quite an achievement. In 2018, she gave me a beautiful little boy; Oscar. She is a loving and caring mum, accompanying Oscar every step of the way to build creativity, curiosity and confidence, at home and on the road.</p><h2><strong>○ Adrien</strong></h2><p>(by Melanie)</p><p>I would never thank enough Adrien for pushing me to embrace cycling in my daily life. It is such a great way of moving and travelling. It was probably hard work but Adrien can be very convincing. There are many qualities I love in Adrien, such as his honesty, curiosity and openness to new ideas (even though it takes some well crafted arguments). He is ready to stand up and act for important causes, in particular climate change. He is the practical and realistic side of the couple, which is sometimes annoying, but overall I must admit it could be reassuring and comforting. Always optimistic, with plan B (and C, and D, ..), which is very useful while on the road where  mishaps are bound to happen. His almost perfect sense of direction is also very helpful, although sometimes it fails spectacularly ( like when we were trapped in a steep sided river in remote Nepal at dusk without lights ...). He is an amazing daddy to our little one and Oscar is very lucky to have a dad that teaches him "technics" such as how to ride a bike by himself.</p><h2>☆ Oscar</h2><p>(by Mummy and Daddy)</p><p>Our little boy has been travelling on wheels every day pretty much since he was born. He is super enthusiastic and easy going during our trips. It is such a fantastic journey to follow him as he is growing and becoming confident, clever and curious but also funny and mischievous. We dream to live a big cycle adventure as a family and we would like Oscar to be fully involved in the journey, so we might have to wait a few more years. <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">We can buy lots of things in life, but as far as we know we cannot buy time, and time with Oscar is gold. While we are on the road for short or longer trips, we want to share our love for Nature with him and to foster his curiosity and confidence. Now that he has started to cycle by himself, there will be new lessons to learn such as patience and perseverance</span><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">...</span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Obviously, sometimes mishaps happens when you are on the road with a a young kid, however it is clearly balanced with numerous enjoyable moments and positive impacts.</span></p></div><footer><div class="post__updated">Updated: <time datetime="2021-05-22T00:35">May 22, 2021</time></div><div class="post__share"><a
